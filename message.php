<pre>Hi guys! you log in successfully!
    This is just a test page,
    I think we should discuss about the use of session or cookie for our user to work in different files here
    I just redirect our user here and I will implement further features when we agree on issue related to cookie or session
    Sincerely,
    Linh Nguyen :D

    p/s: btw, I am using Php storm and It's a great tool, you guys should try it, we can apply for a student pack which we can use
    these software for free :D
